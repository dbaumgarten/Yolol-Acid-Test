## Yolol Acid Test

A set of Yolol scripts which have all been tested to produce the value "ok" **in game** ([Starbase](https://store.steampowered.com/app/454120/Starbase/)). These can be used to test new implementation of Yolol.

The `conformance` folder contains scripts which are each designed to test one area of the language.

The `benchmark` folder contains benchmark scripts which are intended to test the speed of a Yolol implementation.
